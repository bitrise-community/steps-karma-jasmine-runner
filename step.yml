title: Karma Jasmine Test Runner
summary: Run your Jasmine tests with the Karma tool on Bitrise. 
description: |-
  The Step allows you to run Jasmine tests using the Karma tool in your build. Karma lets you spawn different browsers and re-run the tests within each browser. 

  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  The Step runs the `karma start` command to run your Jasmine tests. To set this up:
  
  1. Choose the browsers in which you want to run tests. Separate each browser with a comma. 
  1. In the **Options to append to the karma start command**, add custom options to the `karma start` command. For the available options, run `karma start --help` in a command line.
